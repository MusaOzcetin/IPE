The master’s program, which is offered in English, reflects this diversity by preparing you for the quickly changing demands of an increasingly global employment market. As a graduate of the Computer Science master’s program, your professional specialization is developing solutions to problems. The vast majority of our graduates are involved in developing hardware and software systems for businesses, technology, healthcare and administration. The number of purely IT businesses has decreased with the rise of IT-related companies. By IT-related companies we mean manufacturers of technical products (automotive construction, machine construction) but also banks, insurance companies, trading companies, or administrative organizations. With their outstanding analytical and communication skills, university-educated computer scientists are also indispensable for consultancy businesses.",
          "On the other hand, your scientific education particularly qualifies you for fields of activity in research and science, both in governmental institutions and in research departments of industry. Those who do not initially decide to enter the world of business directly can pursue further scientific qualification within the framework of a doctorate .",
          "Another tipp: you could start your own business. Berlin is currently home to the most vibrant start-up scene in Europe. There are a number of institutes and facilities within the University offering you the chance to get some inspiration and to support you with setting up your own business. These include the award winning Career Service and the Centre for Entrpreneurship (CfE). The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science additionally has its own representative for business start ups to provide you with practical advice and to put you in touch with a valuable network."
