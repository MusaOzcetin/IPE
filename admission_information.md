# Bachelor

## German Higher Education Entrance Qualification  
If you have a German higher education entrance qualification (e.g., Abitur), you generally qualify for bachelor’s studies at TU Berlin. A general qualification grants access to all programs; a subject-specific qualification restricts your options. A Fachabitur is not sufficient. Recognized certificates include Abitur (domestic or German schools abroad), Europäisches Abitur (with conversion and language proof), AbiBac (with conversion), and completed degrees from German state-recognized universities.  
All bachelor’s programs require German language proficiency.

## First Bachelor Semester – Restricted Admission (NC)  
If your desired program has restricted admission (NC), you must submit a formal application. Program profiles indicate whether admission is restricted and which semester starts are offered.

---

## First Bachelor Semester – Open Admission  
If your program has open admission, you can enroll directly online and create your enrollment application in tuPORT.

---

## Higher Bachelor Semester – Restricted Admission (NC)  
If you have recognized prior coursework and have been classified into a higher semester, you must apply formally for admission to the higher semester of an NC program.

---

## Higher Bachelor Semester – Open Admission  
If you have been placed into a higher semester of an open-admission program, you may enroll directly online.

---

## Remaining Places After NC  
If NC programs still have unfilled spots after the main procedures, remaining places are allocated via a lottery (Losverfahren).

---

## International Certificates – anabin Check Required  
If you hold an international school certificate, you must check the anabin database to determine whether your qualification grants direct, indirect, or no access to German universities.

---

## International Certificates – Direct Admission  
If anabin classifies your certificate as providing direct access, you may apply to a bachelor’s program if you also meet TU Berlin’s other requirements (uni-assist verification, language level, correct documents, deadlines).

---

## International Certificates – Indirect Admission (Studienkolleg)  
If anabin requires Studienkolleg or the Feststellungsprüfung, you must complete this process before applying directly to a bachelor’s program.

---

## International Certificates – No University Entrance  
If anabin indicates no university entrance qualification, you must obtain a recognized certificate through adult education or second-chance pathways offered in Berlin.

---

## Professional Qualification – Overview (Section 11 BerlHG)  
Certain professional qualifications can grant access to bachelor’s studies. Depending on your background, an entrance examination may be required. Detailed instructions are provided in the program information.

---

## Professional Qualification – Advanced Training / Technical School  
Advanced training or technical school qualifications generally satisfy the formal requirements for bachelor’s admission and may grant broad subject access.

---

## Professional Qualification – Vocational Training  
A vocational qualification of at least two years may grant access to bachelor’s studies in a related subject area. An entrance examination may be required for unrelated fields.

---

## Professional Qualification – Transfer from Another Federal State  
If you were admitted to a bachelor’s program in another federal state based on professional qualification and completed at least one year of study there, you may continue the same program at TU Berlin in a higher semester.

---

# Master

## Completed First University Degree (General Requirement)  
A completed first degree (e.g., bachelor’s, Diplom, Magister, Staatsexamen) from an accredited university is required for master’s admission. You must upload complete transcripts, module lists, and officially verified documents. Applications without proof of a first degree or permitted ECTS certificate are rejected.

---

## Ongoing Bachelor’s Studies – EHEA (First Master Semester Only)  
If you study at an EHEA university and have not yet received your bachelor’s degree, you may apply for the **first** master’s semester with an ECTS certificate showing all modules, credits, and grades.  
A completed bachelor's degree is always required for higher-semester master’s applications.

---

## Ongoing Bachelor’s Studies – Non-EHEA  
If your first degree is not within the EHEA or part of an unfinished Diplom/Magister/Staatsexamen, you must complete the degree before applying. A Vordiplom or a master's degree alone does not fulfill the requirement for a first degree.

---

## Degree from a German Cooperative University  
If your first degree comes from a German cooperative university, you must provide proof that the institution was accredited at the time of your graduation.

---

## Professional Qualification Only (No First Degree)  
A professional qualification alone does not permit admission to master’s programs. Section 11 BerlHG applies only to bachelor’s access. You must provide proof of a completed first university degree.

---

## Dual Degree Applicants  
Dual degree students may apply using documentation from their German and/or foreign universities. If applying with an ECTS certificate, all foreign credits must already be converted by the partner university; TU Berlin and uni-assist do not recalculate credits.

---

## Additional Requirements (Languages, Internships, etc.)  
Some master’s programs require additional qualifications such as language certificates or internships. These must be fulfilled alongside general and subject-specific admission requirements.

---

## Content Advising  
If you are unsure whether your first degree aligns with a specific master’s program, you should contact the program’s Course Guidance (Fachstudienberatung) for individual advising.
